You are a scientist at a space research center. The center is currently researching various planets and their properties. One of the properties they are interested in is the surface area of these planets. Considering that a planet can be approximated as a sphere, your task is to create a method that calculates the surface area of a sphere given its radius.
**Hint:** The formula to calculate the surface area of a sphere is:
A = 4πr^2
Where:
- A is the surface area of the sphere
- r is the radius of the sphere
**Class Definition:**
public class PlanetExplorer {
public double calculateSurfaceArea(double radius);
}
**Inputs:**
The method calculateSurfaceArea(double radius) will receive one parameter:
- radius : a double representing the radius of the sphere (planet).
**Outputs:**
The method will return a double - the surface area of the sphere.
**Example:**
**Sample Input:**
PlanetExplorer explorer = new PlanetExplorer();
explorer.calculateSurfaceArea(3.0);
**Sample Output:**
113.10
